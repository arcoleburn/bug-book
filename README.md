Bug book will be a simple journaling app, inspired by Jim Collin's journaling practices described here: 
https://tim.blog/2019/02/20/the-tim-ferriss-show-transcripts-jim-collins-361/

The purpose of Bug Book is to help users discover and learn more about themselves. In the words of Jim Collins, 
"we struggle in our 20s to get clarity about how to deploy ourselves in the world. Because everything up until 
you finish high school, or college, or graduate school, or whatever, it’s structured. You don’t really have to 
think about it. It’s like, “Oh, I gotta figure out how to do these math problems,” or whatever. But life isn’t 
really like that. And then all of a sudden, you hit life and life is much more ambiguous. And so, you’re trying 
to navigate through it. So I, like a lot of people, was trying to figure out how to best to deploy myself in my 20s."

The idea is for users to study themselves as a scientist would study a newly discovered bug, imagining that they are
observing, with dispassionate objectivity, a bug called <their name>. Its scientific, almost clinical. A scientist doesn't
judge the bug they are studying, they merely observe and note what makes it tick. 

At its core, bug book will allow users to keep a daily log of: 
1.) an account of their activities that day (ie: woke up early, wrote for 3 hours, went to work, went out to dinner with Jane, read for an hour, went to bed) 
2.) any self-observations they made that day, as if analyzing a newly found species as a scientist. (ie: The bug John gets really excited when he gets the chance to explain things he is knowledgeable about to others.) 
3.) A rating of the day, on a simple scale from -2 to +2, where -2 is an awful day, +2 is a great day, and 0 is a neutral/meh day. 

At any point, users will be able to filter their past entries, view a collection of their observations, etc.

Beyond that, Bug Book will allow users to track a variety of things in their lives, to help discover what might affect them day to day. 
The defaults will be the 3 core inputs above, plus a "10,000 hours" tracker, that each day logs the amount of time a user spent on
creative/intellectual/deep/meaningful work.
Then, users will be able to choose from a wealth of categories to track including: 
-previous nights sleep 
-caffeine consumption 
-alcohol consumption
-exercise time 
-meditation time 
etc. 

Users will also be able to create their own categories to track. Curious if video game time is affecting you? Track that, and compare to the rest of the data. 

Once enough data has been collected, users will be able to see visualizations that hopefully help them understand themselves better. 
These will include: 
- collection of self-observations
- graphs correlating daily score with any other data point 
- daily score over time
- creative hours over time 
- and more, potentially custom.
